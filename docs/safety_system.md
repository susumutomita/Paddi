# Paddi Safety System Documentation

## Overview

The Paddi Safety System is a comprehensive framework designed to prevent LLM hallucination risks and protect against potentially dangerous command executions. It provides multiple layers of protection including command validation, dry-run simulation, impact analysis, human approval workflows, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Key Features

### 1. Command Validation
- **Pattern-based risk detection**: Identifies dangerous command patterns
- **Risk level assessment**: Categorizes commands as LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, or CRITICAL risk
- **Command type classification**: Identifies READ_ONLY, CONFIGURATION, PERMISSION, DELETION, NETWORK commands
- **Warning generation**: Provides contextual warnings for potentially risky operations

### 2. Dry-Run Simulation
- **Safe execution preview**: Shows what would happen without making actual changes
- **Resource identification**: Lists affected resources and services
- **Impact visualization**: Demonstrates potential consequences before execution

### 3. Impact Analysis
- **Resource mapping**: Identifies all resources that would be affected
- **Service dependency tracking**: Shows which services might be impacted
- **Downtime estimation**: Predicts potential service interruptions
- **Reversibility assessment**: Determines if changes can be undone
- **Rollback command generation**: Provides commands to reverse changes when possible

### 4. Human Approval Workflow
- **Mandatory approval for high-risk commands**: Requires human review for critical operations
- **Auto-approval rules**: Allows safe, low-risk commands to proceed automatically
- **Approval tracking**: Maintains complete history of all approval decisions
- **Timeout management**: Expires old requests to prevent stale approvals

### 5. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- **Complete command history**: Records all validation and execution attempts
- **User tracking**: Identifies who executed each command
- **Risk assessment logging**: Records risk levels and validation results
- **Searchable logs**: Allows filtering by user, risk level, time range, etc.
- **Export capabilities**: Supports JSON and CSV export formats

## Usage Examples

### Validating Commands

```bash
# Validate a potentially dangerous command
python main.py validate-command "firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=443/tcp"

# Output shows:
# ⚠️ CRITICAL RISK DETECTED - Manual review required
# Risk Level: CRITICAL
# Risks: Removing firewall rules can block critical services
# Approval required before execution
```

### Executing Remediation Commands

```bash
# Execute with safety checks (dry-run by default)
python main.py execute-remediation "systemctl stop nginx"

# Execute after approval
python main.py execute-remediation "rm -rf /old-data" --approval-id=<approval-id>
```

### Managing Approvals

```bash
# List pending approvals
python main.py list-approvals

# Approve a command
python main.py approve <approval-id>

# Reject a command
python main.py reject <approval-id> "Too risky for production"
```

### Viewing Audit Logs

```bash
# View audit report for last 7 days
python main.py audit-log

# Filter by user
python main.py audit-log --user=alice --days=30

# Filter by risk level
python main.py audit-log --risk-level=high
```

### Running Safety Demo

```bash
# See the safety system in action with example commands
python main.py safety-demo
```

## Risk Levels

### LOW Risk
- Read-only operations (list, get, status)
- No system changes
- Auto-approved by default

### MEDIUM Risk
- Configuration changes
- Service restarts
- Reversible operations

### HIGH Risk
- Permission changes
- Service disruptions
- Requires approval

### CRITICAL Risk
- Data deletion
- Network isolation
- Irreversible changes
- Always requires manual approval

## Safety Patterns

### Dangerous Patterns Detected
- Firewall rule removal
- IAM policy binding removal
- Recursive deletions
- Service stops/disables
- Permission restrictions (chmod 000)
- Quiet/force flags on destructive operations

### Safe Patterns Recognized
- List/get operations
- Status checks
- Read-only commands
- Echo/cat commands

## Best Practices

1. **Always run dry-run first**: Test commands in dry-run mode before actual execution
2. **Review impact analysis**: Understand what resources and services will be affected
3. **Use approval workflow**: Get peer review for high-risk operations
4. **Check rollback options**: Ensure you can reverse changes if needed
5. **Monitor audit logs**: Regularly review command execution history
6. **Document decisions**: Include reasons when approving/rejecting commands

## Configuration

### Auto-Approval Rules
The system can be configured to auto-approve:
- Low-risk read-only commands
- Operations on test/development resources
- Commands from trusted automation accounts

### Approval Timeout
Default: 1 hour
Pending approvals expire after the timeout period to prevent stale approvals.

### Audit Log Retention
Logs are stored in JSON Lines format with daily rotation.
Configure retention period based on compliance requirements.

## Integration with Paddi

The safety system is fully integrated into Paddi's remediation workflow:

1. **During Analysis**: AI-suggested remediations are validated
2. **Before Execution**: All commands go through safety checks
3. **Approval Integration**: High-risk remediations require approval
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all security remediations

## Security Considerations

- **Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions
- **Audit Log Protection**: Secure audit logs with appropriate access controls
- **Approval Authentication**: Verify approver identity
- **Command Injection**: Validate and sanitize all command inputs
- **Secrets Protection**: Never log sensitive data like passwords or keys

## Troubleshooting

### "Command requires approval"
The command has been identified as high-risk. Request approval from an administrator.

### "Approval request expired"
Approvals expire after 1 hour. Re-validate the command to create a new request.

### "Unknown command pattern"
The safety system couldn't categorize the command. Review manually and consider adding new patterns.

### "Dry-run simulation unavailable"
Some commands can't be simulated. Review the command documentation for --dry-run options.

## Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based risk assessment
- Integration with change management systems
- Real-time monitoring of command execution
- Automated rollback on failure detection
- Multi-factor authentication for critical approvals
